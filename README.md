# Dallas Indian Restaurants - Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for a machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting ratings of Indian restaurants in Dallas.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

* Gather data on Indian restaurants in Dallas.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the factors influencing restaurant ratings.
* Develop machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings.
* Evaluate the performance of the models.

## Notebook

* [Final_Capstone_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/anatarajank/Dallas_Indian_Restaurants_ML/blob/master/Final_Capstone_Project.ipynb): This notebook contains the complete analysis, including data collection, EDA, model building, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, you will need:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` if available, or check the notebook for specific imports).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/anatarajank/Dallas_Indian_Restaurants_ML.git](https://github.com/anatarajank/Dallas_Indian_Restaurants_ML.git)
    cd Dallas_Indian_Restaurants_ML
    ```

2.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required packages. If you have a `requirements.txt` file, use:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Otherwise, install the necessary libraries as specified within the notebook.

4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Final_Capstone_Project.ipynb
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    jupyter lab Final_Capstone_Project.ipynb
    ```
